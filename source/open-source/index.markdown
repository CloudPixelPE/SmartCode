## Release Candidate

Release Candidate is a Maven plugin that makes integrating Maven projects with Continuous Delivery pipelines a little bit easier.

The plugin allows your build server to read the current version of a Maven project and update it automatically as part of the build process to include any additional metadata, such as an identifier of the commit that triggered the build, current timestamp, build number, etc.

Release Candidate is designed to work with any popular CI server, such as Jenkins, TeamCity and others.
